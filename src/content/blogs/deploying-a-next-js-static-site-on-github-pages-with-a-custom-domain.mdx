For a long time, I wanted to create a single page that truly represented me. At the start of this month, I bought the domain [**_hiteshshetty.com_**](https://hiteshshetty.com/) on GoDaddy. Since my name is fairly common, I was worried it might already be taken but fortunately, it was available.

With most of my content ready, I decided to keep the stack simple: Next.js with Static Site Generation (SSG), deployed via GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

***

## 1. Configure Next.js for SSG

### Build settings (next.config.ts)

In `next.config.ts`, add:

![Next.js SSG Configuration](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/next-ssg-configuration.webp)

This enables Next.js to export static pages for all routes in the app.

### Add a `.nojekyll` file

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website.

GitHub Pages runs Jekyll by default, which ignores files and folders that start with an **underscore**. Next.js outputs assets under `/_next`, so without disabling Jekyll your CSS and JS will not load.

Create an empty `.nojekyll` file in `public/`:

```bash
touch public/.nojekyll
```

That's it, GitHub Pages will skip Jekyll, and your static assets will load correctly.

***

## 2. Configure the GitHub repository

### Choose GitHub Pages source

In your repository, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages. Under ‚ÄúBuild and deployment,‚Äù choose GitHub Actions as the source.

### Set up the deployment workflow

You have two options:

- **Use a prebuilt GitHub Actions workflow for Next.js Pages:**
  `https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>/actions/new?category=pages&query=Next`

![Configure prebuilt action in your repo](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/configure-pre-built-action.webp)

- **Or reuse the workflow I used in my repo:** <a href="https://github.com/hiteshshetty-dev/hiteshshetty.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deploy.yml</a>

Once the action is configured, any merge to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment. When it succeeds, your site will be available at:

```bash
https://<username>.github.io/<repo_name>
```

Verify that the site loads and all routes work.

## 3. Configure a custom domain

### Update DNS records at your registrar

> Some domain registrars add their own A records to display a landing page until you configure your website. This means they may populate A records that can be safely deleted. I personally spent half an hour debugging random redirects to a landing page while navigating üò≠.

**A records for apex (root) domain**

An **A record** (Address Record) is a fundamental type of DNS record that maps a **domain name** (like `hiteshshetty.com`) to an **IPv4 address** (like `185.199.108.153`).

When someone types your domain, DNS looks up the A record and retrieves its corresponding IP address. The browser then connects to that IP address to fetch your website.

GitHub Pages <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#:~:text=for%20GitHub%20Pages.-,185.199.108.153%0A185.199.109.153%0A185.199.110.153%0A185.199.111.153,-To%20create%20AAAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP addresses:</a>

```text
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

Configure these as A records for `@` shorthand (or `your-domain.com`).

![DNS A Records Configuration](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/dns-record-configuration.webp)

**CNAME for** `**www**`

A CNAME points one hostname to another. To support `www.your-domain.com`, add a CNAME that aliases `www` to your GitHub Pages domain: `<username>.github.io.`

DNS propagation usually takes around 15 minutes but can take up to 24 hours. You can check propagation with tools like <a href="https://dnschecker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dnschecker.org</a> or via `dig` command:

For A record:

![Checking A record propagation status using Dnschecker.org](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/a-record-propagation-dnschecker.webp)

or use the dig command:

```bash
dig your-domain.com +noall +answer -t A
```

Example output:

```bash
‚ùØ dig hiteshshetty.com +noall +answer -t A

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> hiteshshetty.com +noall +answer -t A
;; global options: +cmd
hiteshshetty.com.       338     IN      A       185.199.111.153
hiteshshetty.com.       338     IN      A       185.199.109.153
hiteshshetty.com.       338     IN      A       185.199.110.153
hiteshshetty.com.       338     IN      A       185.199.108.153
```
For CNAME:


![Checking CNAME propagation status using Dnschecker.org](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/c-name-dnschecker.webp)

or use the dig command:

```bash
dig www.your-domain.com +noall +answer -t CNAME
```

Example output:

```bash
‚ùØ dig www.hiteshshetty.com +noall +answer -t CNAME

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> www.hiteshshetty.com +noall +answer -t CNAME
;; global options: +cmd
www.hiteshshetty.com.   3600    IN      CNAME   hiteshshetty-dev.github.io.
```

### Add a `CNAME` file

Tell GitHub Pages which domain to serve by adding a `CNAME` file in `public/`:

```bash
echo "your_domain_name.com" > public/CNAME
```

Notes:

- The file must contain only the domain name
- Do not include `http://` or `https://`
- No trailing slash

### Enable the domain in GitHub Pages

After DNS propagates, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages in your repo.

- Enter your custom domain and Save
- Wait for GitHub to issue a TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt
- Then enable "Enforce HTTPS"

![GitHub Pages Configuration](/images/blogs/deploying-a-next-js-static-site-on-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain/github-pages-configuration.webp)

Your site will now be served over HTTPS on your custom domain.
